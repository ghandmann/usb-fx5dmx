# USB::FX5DMX

A perl module for the FX5 DMX USB-Interface from DigitalEnlightment.

The module is basicly a wrapper around the c/c++ interface provided by https://github.com/fx5/usbdmx

This software is in an experimental state! It's my first XS-based perl module, and i still got a lot to learn. ;)
